### Description:
I Implemented REST API following the latest standard from the documentation of the tools and technologies I used. I used FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Psycopg, SQLAlchemy (with AsyncIO), pgAdmin, Postman, and Docker in this project. It is a simple social media implementation where users can sign up, log in, create, read, update, and delete posts. It does not have any user interface except Swagger UI. I made it this way to make it reusable for other projects. 

I have learned the FastAPI framework and how to use the Postgres database asynchronously. I specifically used SQLAlchemy to combine it with other asynchronous databases in the future. I also learned to do API testing using Postman, use and configure Docker, and implement OAuth2 with password hashing and JWT tokens.
